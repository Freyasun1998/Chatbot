          <br>

          <h4><mark>Analysis on the Impact of Russia-Ukraine Conflict to the Commodity Market using Reddit data</mark>
          </h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            During this year, the financial market is having extra turmoil due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine Conflict.
            This project aims to study this event from a perspective combining the commodity market with online social
            media. Modern finance theory holds that asset prices are mainly affected by market and psychological
            factors. Global economies are presently facing severe challenges due to food and energy shortages, since
            Ukraine and Russia are among the major exporters of wheat, natural gas, etc. From a behavioral finance
            perspective, geopolitical conflict can have an impact on investors’ psychological factors, which in turn can
            have an impact on commodity prices. This project will explore the relationship between the food and energy
            commodity market and Russia-Ukraine related Reddit posts, in hope that the data can capture both market and
            psychological factors. If another emergent event happens in the future, a similar approach can be conducted
            to evaluate the impact on commodity markets.

                  Feb with the average price changes before that time with consideration of standard deviation. 3) It is
                  also useful to discuss which commodity had the largest price change, and whether that price movement
                  matches with economic data.<br><br>
                  The goal is to examine economic data such as export/import from Russia and Ukraine to identify if the

                  be
                  found between historical export/import and commodity market prices. Having an understanding of the
                  fundamentals can help deliver a comprehensive reasoning behind the change in commodity prices.<br>
                  <br>
                  Starting from the naïve Pearson correlation, this project will explore which commodities tend to move
                  together. Since new events can introduce changes to commodity fundamentals, it is also important to
                  compare the correlation before and after the conflict. To consider lag and lead effects, this project
                  can conduct cross-correlation analysis as a next step.
