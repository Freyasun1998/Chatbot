      <strong>Chatbots</strong> 
      generally represent for the software applications which can 
      carry out live conversations with users' utterances in the form of text or audio. 
      While a lot of research has been done on chatbots for the theories and engineering techniques, 
      a number of chatbot applications have been also developed in different settings.
      The chatbots could be divided into different categories according to the usage and principles behind,
      among which some popular ones are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customer Service Chatbots:</strong> Carry out Q&As and provide service options
      for the customers. Typical examples are customer service chatbots of e-commerce companies,
      such as <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Ebay</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Task Oriented Chatbots:</strong> Answer questions and have the ability to
        complete specific tasks, such as scheduling appointments and making calls. 
        Two typical examples are <strong>Siri</strong> from <strong>Apple</strong> and 
        <strong>Cortana</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Open Domain Chatbots:</strong> Chat with users in turns in an open domain, not 
      restricted to specific tasks, sometimes within certain topics. </li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Project Goals</strong>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
      For our project, we place our interests and efforts on the open-domain chatbots.
      We expect to build an open-domain chatbot with dramatic responses,
      which has the ability of 'chatting' with the user in an interesting and interactive way.

    </p>
    <p>
      Our basic idea is first load the open-source pre-trained models of <strong>DialoGPT</strong>,
      which are from microsoft and trained primarily on twits and reddits.
      Then we finetune the model on the movie dialogue corpus, 
      in the assumption that conversations in movies tend to be more dramatic and 
      emotional, different from common conversations with more apparent features that is easy for us to build models, specifically tweets and reddits. 
      We finally deploy the chatbots using google voice API. More technical details are provided in the
      following parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our business goal is to give the user a surprise, a sense of happiness, 
      and a relief temporarily from the heavy everyday work and studies.
    </p>

      <strong>Pre-trained Model</strong>
    </h4>
    <br>
            <p><strong>DialoGPT</strong> from <strong>microsoft</strong></p>
            <p> Model link from <strong>huggingface</strong>: <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium">microsoft/DialoGPT</a></p>
            <ul>
            <p>
             The DialoGPT was released by Microsoft and trained with 147M multi-turn dialogues extracted from Reddit discussion threads. It has strong flexibility and robustness. As an autoregressive (AR) language model which uses a multi-layer transformer as its model architecture, it establishes a foundation for building versatile open-domain chatbots which can deliver engaging and natural conversational responses across various topics, tasks, and information requests, without resorting to heavy hand-crafting.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              According to the human evaluation results, the response generated from DialoGPT is comparable to human response quality under a single-turn conversation Turing test.

      <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>
    </h4>
            <p>
                First, we joined the csv files and got all the conversations in movies tagged by ‘comedy’.
            </P>
            <p>
                Since we trained the models using movie dialogues data, 
                there are too many repeated sentences like ‘Yes’, ‘No’, ‘I don’t know’, ‘I’m sorry’ in our training data sets. 
                To avoid the situation the chatbot respond too many such words to users instead of humorous responses, 
                we removed these superfluous words from our training dataset. 
            </P>
            <p>
                In experiments of interacting with this chatbot, we found that it tends to give very short response. 
                Since the business goal of this chatbot is to help users to pass the time away and gives users entertainment, 
                such short conversations are not wanted by users. Therefore, we filtered out all sentences with length under 10.
            </P>

    <h4 style='font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;'>
      <strong>Deploy</strong>
    </h4>
            <p>
                We used Google Voice API to receive messages, autosave messages to gmail. 
                Then processed unread messages every 5 seconds, using our models. 
                Finally sent processed messages through our virtual number (+1 2028884948). 
                All messages were processed in different sessions which are classified by sender numbers.
            </P>
            <p>
                Since there were no extra machines nor rent any servers, 
                we deployed our models just on Google Colab. 
                Considering the price of google colab, it is not 24-hour deployed, only running when we want to make interactions with our chatbot.
            </P>

                To adjust the chatbot precisely so as to bring to the highest level of performance and effective, 
                the hardware support we chose for training is Colab Pro+ with 800 compute units which cost us $530 per month.

              <li>
                To ensure that we have enough cloud storage, we used Google One with 100 GB storage which cost us $2 per month.

                DialoGPT is a SOTA large-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model for nultiturn conversations. 
                In the human evaluation, we have used three DialoGPT with different size and compare the time of response generated from DialoGPT. 
              
            <p>
                We waited around 35 minutes for DialoGPT-small (0.5 GB) to respond, 
                80 minutes for DialoGPT-medium (1.4 GB) to respond, 135 minutes for DialoGPT-large (2.9 GB) to respond.

    <p>Going through a testing phrase before releasing our chat robot is quite important. 
      We must keep on monitoring results even after going live. 
      We have performed many experiments using models of different size and training data sets. 
      Finally, we got a satisfying chatbot whose name is SweetHeart. 
      SweetHeart was implemented with DialoGPT-medium and the dataset after cleaning.</p>

      We interacted with our SweetHeart using common sentences, philosophical questions, quotes of Darks Souls & 
      Elden Ring, poems by Load Byron. And in reply our SweetHeart presented us with some surprises!
    </p>
    <p>
      While original DialoGPT tends to give longer replies as illustrations to the question 
      'What's the meaning of Life?', this chatbot tends to reply in a short and smarter way, which 
      is expected in movie conversations.

      <strong>Conclusions</strong>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
      Above is all about our NLP final project regarding building a chatbot. 
      Although our SweetHeart chatbot interacts with us as what we've expected, 
      more complex structures and more advanced techniques can be applied to our chatbot in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a famous and instructive quote from <strong>Dr. Seuss</strong>:
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: cursive;">
       The more that you read, the more things you will know.<br>
        The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.
    </p>
    <p>
      While our chatbot has learned from the movie conversations, 
      it is expected that it can learn from daily conversations which have less features and interacted as real. 
      We ourselves also need to keep learning from more papers and applications, 
      in the hope to improve our lovely chatbot and build more interesting and elegant models in the future.

    <h4 style='font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;'>
      <strong>Future Work</strong>
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p> 
      There are still some goals we need to achieve in the future to improve the performance of our model. 
      For the method we used this time, it simply shuffles the training dataset. 
      It may perform much better if we try state-of-the-art planning strategies. 
      Also, if we finetune on larger datasets that balanced and explicitly in some certain utterance style, 
      the quality of reply of our chatbot can be higher. 
      The reply from our model contains a lots of adversarial or meaningless sentences. 
      So we need to find a solution to filter those unwanted replies.</p>
